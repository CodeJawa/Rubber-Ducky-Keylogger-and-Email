# Rubber-Ducky-Keylogger-and-Email
This is some ducky script code that runs a keylogger script and an email script to email the keylogger file to a specific email. The original creator of the keylogger script is Creator: Securethelogs | @Securethelogs. All that I have done was take that script and combine it with an email script all written in ducky script code so that it can be installed and run on a Rubber Ducky USB.

On Line 16 of the code. Edit the parts of the script labeled "Recieving Email, "Sender Email", "SMTP Server Email is Using", and "Sender Email Password" to whatever those are to you. You can also edit the delay at the end of line 16 to be as long as you want between emails sent.

You can also use the code on lines 7 and 16 seperatly from the other code as you see fit.
